"""
application core constants, helper functions and base classes
=============================================================

this module declares practical constants, tiny helper functions and app base classes, which are reducing the code of
your application (and of other ae namespace modules/portions).

core constants
--------------

there are three debug level constants: :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_DISABLED`, :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_ENABLED` and
:data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_VERBOSE`. short names for all debug level constants are provided by the dict :data:`DEBUG_LEVELS`.
the debug level of your application can be either set in your code or optionally data-driven externally (using the
:ref:`config-files` or :ref:`config-options` of the module :mod:`ae.console`).

to use the :mod:`python logging module <logging>` in conjunction with this module the constant :data:`LOGGING_LEVELS` is
providing a mapping between the debug levels and the python logging levels.

the encoding of strings into byte-strings (to output them to the console/stdout or to file contents) can be tricky
sometimes. to not lose any logging output because of invalid characters this module will automatically handle any
:exc:`UnicodeEncodeError` exception for you. invalid characters will then automatically be converted to the default
encoding (specified by :data:`~ae.base.DEF_ENCODING`) with the default error handling method specified by
:data:`~ae.base.DEF_ENCODE_ERRORS` (both defined in the :mod:`ae.base` namespace portion/module.


core helper functions
---------------------

the :func:`print_out` function, which is fully compatible to pythons :func:`print`, is using the encode helpers
:func:`~ae.base.force_encoding` and :func:`~.ae.base.to_ascii` to auto-correct invalid characters.

the function :func:`hide_dup_line_prefix` is very practical if you want to remove or hide redundant line prefixes in
your log files, to make them better readable.


application base classes
------------------------

the classes :class:`AppBase` and :class:`SubApp` are applying logging and debugging features to your application. create
in your application one instance of :class:`AppBase` to represent the main application task. if your application needs a
separate logging/debugging configuration for sub-threads or sub-tasks then create an :class:`SubApp` instance for each
of these sub-apps.

sub-apps are very flexible and not tied to any fix use-case. they can be created e.g. for each sub-task or application
thread. you could also create a :class:`SubApp` instance for each of your external systems, like a database server or to
connect your application onto different test environments or to your live an your production system (e.g. for system
comparison and maintenance).

both application classes are automatically catching and handling any exceptions and run-time errors: only if any
critical exception/error cannot be handled then the :meth:`~AppBase.shutdown` method will make sure that all sub-apps
and threads get terminated and joined. additionally all print-out buffers will be flushed to include all the info of the
critical error (the last debug and error messages) into the standard error/output and into any activated log files.


basic usage of an application base class
........................................

at the top of your python application main file/module create an instance of the class :class:`AppBase`::

    \"\"\"  docstring at the top of the main module of your application  \"\"\"
    from ae.core import AppBase

    __version__ = '1.2.3'

    ca = AppBase()

in the above example the :class:`AppBase` instance will automatically use the docstring title of the module as
application title and the string in the module variable __version___ as application version. to overwrite these defaults
pass your application title and version string via the arguments :paramref:`~AppBase.app_title` and
:paramref:`~AppBase.app_version` to the instantiation of :class:`AppBase`::

    ca = AppBase(app_title="title of this app instance", app_version='3.2.1')

other automatically initialized instance attributes of :class:`AppBase` are documented underneath in the
:class:`class docstring <AppBase>`. they include e.g. the
:attr:`date and time when the instance got created <AppBase.startup_beg>`, the
:attr:`name/id of this application instance <AppBase.app_name>` or the :attr:`application path <AppBase.app_path>`.


application class hierarchy
...........................

for most use cases you will not instantiate from :class:`AppBase` directly - instead you will instantiate one of the
extended application classes that are inherited from this base class.

the class :class:`~ae.console.ConsoleApp` e.g. inherits from :class:`AppBase` and is adding configuration options and
variables to it. so in your console application it is recommended to directly use instances of
:class:`~ae.console.ConsoleApp` instead of :class:`AppBase`.

for applications with an GUI use instead one of the classes :class:`~ae.kivy_app.KivyApp`,
:class:`~ae.enaml_app.EnamlApp` or :class:`~ae.toga_app.TogaApp`.


application logging
-------------------

print-outs are an essential tool for the debugging and logging of your application at run-time. in python the print-outs
are done with the :func:`print` function or with the python :mod:`logging` module. these print-outs get per default send
to the standard output and error streams of your OS and so displayed on your system console/shell. the :func:`print_out`
function and the :meth:`~AppBase.print_out` method of this :mod:`.core` module are adding two more sophisticated ways
for print-outs to the console/log-files.

using :class:`AppBase` is making the logging much easier and also ensures that print-outs of any imported library or
package will be included within your log files. this is done by redirecting the standard output and error streams to
your log files with the help of the :class:`_PrintingReplicator` class.

head-less server applications like web servers are mostly not allowed to use the standard output streams. for some these
applications you could redirect the standard output and error streams to a log file by using the OS redirection
character (``>``)::

    python your_application.py >log_std_out.log 2>log_std_err.log

but because most web servers doesn't allow you to use this redirection, you can alternatively specify the
:paramref:`~AppBase.suppress_stdout` parameter as ``True`` in the instantiation of an :class:`AppBase` instance.
additionally you can call the :meth:`~AppBase.init_logging` method to activate a log file. after that all print-outs of
your application and libraries will only appear in your log file.

also in complex applications, where huge print-outs to the console can get lost easily, you want to use a log file
instead. but even a single log file can get messy to read, especially for multi-threaded server applications. for that
:class:`SubApp` is allowing you to create for each thread a separate sub-app instance with its own log file.

using this module ensures that any crashes or freezes happening in your application will be fully logged. apart from the
gracefully handling of :exc:`UnicodeEncodeError` exceptions, the :mod:`Python faulthandler <faulthandler>` will be
enabled automatically to catch system errors and to dump a traceback of them to the console and any activated log file.


activate ae log file
....................

.. _ae-log-file:

ae log files are text files using by default the encoding of your OS console/shell. to activate the redirection of your
applications print-outs into a ae log file for a :class:`AppBase` instance you simply specify the file name of the log
file in the :meth:`~AppBase.init_logging` method call::

    app = AppBase()
    app.init_logging(log_file_name='my_log_file.log')


activate ae logging features
............................

for multi-threaded applications include the thread-id of the printing thread automatically into your log files by
passing a ``True`` value to the :paramref:`~AppBase.multi_threading` argument. to additionally also suppress any
print-outs to the standard output/error streams pass ``True`` to the :paramref:`~AppBase.suppress_stdout` argument::

    app = AppBase(multi_threading=True, suppress_stdout=True)
    app.init_logging(log_file_name='my_log_file.log')

the ae log files provided by this module are automatically rotating if the size of an log file succeeds the value in
MBytes defined in the :data:`LOG_FILE_MAX_SIZE`. to adapt this value to your needs you can specify the maximum log file
size in MBytes with the argument :paramref:`~AppBase.init_logging.log_file_size_max` in your call of
:meth:`~AppBase.init_logging`::

    app.init_logging(log_file_name='my_log_file.log', log_file_size_max=9.)

by using the :class:`~ae.console.ConsoleApp` class instead of :class:`AppBase` you can alternatively store the logging
configuration of your application within a :ref:`configuration variable <config-variables>` or a
:ref:`configuration option <config-options>`. the order of precedence to find the appropriate logging configuration of
each app instance is documented :meth:`here <ae.console.ConsoleApp._init_logging>`.


using python logging module
...........................

if you prefer to use instead the python logging module for the print-outs of your application, then pass a
:mod:`python logging configuration dictionary <logging.config>` with the individual configuration of your logging
handlers, files and loggers to the :paramref:`~AppBase.init_logging.py_logging_params` argument of the
:meth:`~AppBase.init_logging` method::

    app.init_logging(py_logging_params=my_py_logging_config_dict)

passing the python logging configuration dictionary to one of the :class:`AppBase` instances created by your application
will automatically disable the ae log file of this instance.


application debugging
---------------------

to use the debug features of :mod:`~.core` you simple have to import the needed
:ref:`debug level constant <debug-level-constants>` to pass it at instantiation of your :class:`AppBase` or
:class:`SubApp` class to the :paramref:`~AppBase.debug_level` argument::

    app = AppBase(..., debug_level= :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_ENABLED`)     # same for :class:`SubApp`

by passing :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_ENABLED` the print-outs (and log file contents) will be more detailed, and even more
verbose if you use instead the debug level :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_VERBOSE`.

the debug level can be changed at any time in your application code by directly assigning the new debug level to the
:attr:`~AppBase.debug_level` property. if you prefer to change the debug levels dynamically, then use the
:class:`~.console.ConsoleApp` instead of :class:`AppBase`, because :class:`~.console.ConsoleApp` provides this property
as a :ref:`configuration file variable <config-variables>` and :ref:`commend line option <config-options>`. this way you
can specify :ref:`the actual debug level <pre-defined-config-options>` without the need to change (and re-build) your
application code.
